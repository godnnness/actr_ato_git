;;; Version Notes: renamed to starcraft from starcrat
;;; A1rev3: Added a second production that /should/ repond to imaginal bufferings.  It doesn't fire yet.
;;; A1rev2: Modified to receive a response
;;; - reduced the number of cycles to 1000
;;; A1rev1: just a loop model. Does not receive a response

;;; This is a trivial example of Voorhees in action. It uses the addition model from the
;;; first unit of the ACT-R tutorial to add numbers, the numbers being supply over a
;;; TCP connection, and the result then being returned over that connection.
;;;
;;; To run the example first ensure you have Voorhees installed as suggested in its
;;; documentation, so that it can be loaded with QuickLisp. Then cd to a directory that
;;; contains an actr7 directory. (Alternatively you can set *actr7-parent*, below, to such
;;; a directory and run this from anywhere.) Then launch Lisp and load this file. It will
;;; start listenting for connections on port 9907 (you can change this port below). Then,
;;; from a separate terminal, send it a JSON object such as
;;;
;;; { "arg1": 3, "arg2": 5 }
;;;
;;; The ACT-R model will be run and the sum returned. For example, if you use netcat (nc)
;;; to connection the interaction in the second terminal might look something like this:
;;;
;;; $ nc localhost 9907
;;; {"arg1": 3, "arg2": 5}
;;; 8
;;; {"arg1": 3, "arg2": 2}
;;; 5
;;;



;; Define the ACT-R model. This will generate a pair of warnings about slots in the goal
;; buffer not being accessed from productions; these may be ignored.
